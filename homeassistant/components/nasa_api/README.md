## Data Sources

### **Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)**

The APOD integration uses the **ImageEntity** from Home Assistant. This entity fetches an image from NASA’s APOD API and displays it within Home Assistant. The image URL is provided through this entity, and additional metadata like the title and description are available as attributes.

- **ImageEntity** is designed for handling images and is optimized for displaying large image files. The entity fetches the image and makes it accessible within Home Assistant’s dashboard.

#### Purpose

NASA's APOD provides a daily image with an accompanying description, offering insights into astronomy and space exploration.

#### How It's Displayed

- **Entity**: `image.astronomy_picture_of_the_day`
- **Attributes**:
  - `title`: The image's title.
  - `description`: A detailed explanation.
  - `date`: The date the APOD was featured.

<img src="/homeassistant/components/nasa_api/images/APOD.png" alt="APOD Image" width="500" />

  "explanation": "A historic capture of Earth rising over the lunar horizon."
}
```

#### Limitations of APOD Display

Due to the limitations of the image entity in Home Assistant, clicking on the APOD image on the dashboard will not display additional details such as the title or explanation. These details are still fetched and available within Home Assistant, but they are not visible on the dashboard by default. This behavior may change with future updates or custom UI configurations.

### **Asteroids - NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service)**

The NEOs integration uses the **SensorEntity** from Home Assistant. This entity tracks various statistics about near-Earth objects (NEOs) provided by NASA’s NeoWs API. It includes data such as the number of NEOs, their sizes, velocities, and hazard potential. These values are displayed in the Home Assistant dashboard as individual sensor entities.

- **SensorEntity** is used to represent numeric or text-based values and is ideal for displaying real-time data such as measurements or counts. The entity fetches the latest data about NEOs and makes it available as individual sensors in the Home Assistant interface.

#### Purpose

NASA’s NeoWs API tracks near-Earth objects, providing crucial information such as asteroid sizes, velocities, closest approach distances, and whether any of them are potentially hazardous. This data helps raise awareness of the objects that come close to Earth’s orbit.

## Custom Dashboard for the NASA integration

To enhance the user experience and overcome the limitations of the APOD integration, where clicking on the image doesn’t provide additional details, creating a custom dashboard in Home Assistant is **highly recommended**.
A custom dashboard will allow you to display detailed information for all available NASA data sources, offering richer insights and a more interactive experience. As a user, you have the flexibility to customize the dashboard to suit your preferences,
creating an intuitive and personalized interface for monitoring your data.
Home Assistant provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide on how to create a custom dashboard, which can be found here:  [Home Assistant Documentation on Creating Dashboards](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/)

## Configuring Alerts for the NASA Data Sources in Home Assistant

Initially, the plan was to code notifications  directly into the NASA integration. However, using **Home Assistant’s Automation** feature provided a more flexible solution. Automations allow for customized notifications based on data changes from NEOs or other NASA data sources. When an alert is triggered, an actionable notification will appear in Home Assistant. It will show updated information, such as the new NEO count. It provide quick access to relevant data or more details. For more information on setting up automations, refer to the [Home Assistant Automation Documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/).

### How to Set Up Notifications in Home Assistant for NEOs integration

Follow these simplified steps to set up notifications for **hazardous NEO** count changes. The same process can be used for other data sources, such as Mars Weather. Just adjust the entity and conditions as needed.

1. Access Automations
   - Open **Home Assistant**.
   - Navigate to **Settings > Automations & Scenes**.
   - Click **+ CREATE AUTOMATION** in the bottom-right corner.
2. Create a New Automation
   - Choose **Start with an empty automation**.
3. Set Up the Trigger
   - Under **Triggers**, click **+ ADD Trigger**.
   - For **Trigger Type**, select **State**.
   - For **Entity**, select `sensor.near_earth_objects_potentially_hazardous_neos`.
   - Set **From** and **To** values for when the count changes (e.g., if it’s greater than zero).
4. Define the Action
   - Under **Actions**, click **+ ADD Action**.
   - Choose **Call Service**.
   - In the **Service** field, select `notify.notify` (or another available notification service).
   - In the **Service Data** field, enter a message like:

        ```yaml
        message: "The count of potentially hazardous NEOs has changed."
        ```

5. Save and Test the Automation
   - Click **Save** to save the automation.
   - Test the automation by triggering it to confirm the notification is sent.

### Example of other Use Cases

- **NEO Close Approach Distance Alert:**
  - **Trigger**: When the **Closest Approach Distance** of any NEO falls below a set threshold (e.g., 1 million km).
  - **Action**: Send a notification with NEO details such as name, distance and close approach date.
